# CODMA PROJECT
This is the top level of the CODMA project. It contains the rtl and the testbench components. In its current status, the project requires scripts to run the tests in the evaluation testbench easier in an open-source simulator.

This project began as a masters design project in 2023. It has been used to improve SystemVerilog coding skills and serves as an example of basic rtl coding abilities.

## Requirements
- Verilator
- Bash environment

## To Do:
- Import the UVM testbench as a submodule 
- Use a BFM style testbench in SystemVerilog
- Use a BFM style testbench in VHDL using OSVVM
- Setup scripts to run tests using open source simulation software, starting with the BFM based tests
- Cleanup project structure
