# CODMA PROJECT
This project began as a masters design project in 2023. It has been used to improve SystemVerilog coding skills and serves as an example of basic rtl coding abilities.

## To Do:
- Import the UVM testbench as a submodule 
- Use a BFM style testbench in SystemVerilog
- Use a BFM style testbench in VHDL using OSVVM
- Setup scripts to run tests using open source simulation software, starting with the BFM based tests
- Cleanup project structure
